## Projects

I'm involved in a lot of different projects from add-ons to games, It's a good
way to stay informed on new development features and improve my skills.

### NodeJS

As as early NodeJS user, i made several modules i
[published on NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/~nfroidure "View my NPM profile").

In particular, i like make JavaScript parsers (CSV, VarStream, SVG...), work
with streams, make plugins and tools
for developers.

### Web apps

I also build HTML5 games for fun and skills, like:

- [Sumuraÿ](http://sumuray.insertafter.com/)
- [Memory](http://memory.insertafter.com/)
- [Break'It](http://breakit.insertafter.com/)
- [Tank Arena](http://tank.elitwork.com/) (work in progress).

I sometimes make some apps during hackathons with friends:

- [Trip Story](https://github.com/nfroidure/TripStory)

And other wierd stuff:

- [WEB MIDI Karaoke player](http://karaoke.insertafter.com/).
- [Hexadecimal Editor](http://hexa.insertafter.com/).

### Firefox / Chrome / Opera add-ons

If you are old enough and used to work with SEO/web contents,
you may have used some of my now unmaintained Firefox add-ons
([KGen](https://github.com/nfroidure/KGen), [BBComposer](https://github.com/nfroidure/BBComposer), [BugMeBack](https://github.com/nfroidure/BugMeBack) et [CanImage](https://github.com/nfroidure/CanImage)), may they rest in peace.

My Thunderbird add-ons is still alive but no maintenance either:

- [CapsKiller](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/caps-killer/).

At the moment, only the Chrome version of [BugMeBack](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bugmeback/hgmagcomobmjhaomdoihiggpdekaehmg?hl=fr) and [KGen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kgen/jkpcelefglapiahikhocfdcigfpaagcl?hl=fr) seems
live but with no maintenance either.

### And many more

You can get the source of my public projects in
 [my GitHub home](https://github.com/nfroidure).
