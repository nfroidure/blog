# About

I follow an ideal of getting technologies to really help the mankind by putting
in practice my ethical principles : ecology, humanism and knowledge sharing.

I found in the web and ITs a way to impact the world in a positive manner.

I like to invent and share so I am particurlarly interested in creating
innovative products.

I'm mainly blogging about web technologies, historically in French, but I try to
translate the most interesting posts into English. Feel free to add your
comments or to contact me if you want to give me your point of view or ask some
explanations about the content I share here.

I wish you'll find this blog useful and hope to see you soon!
