<h2>Complete the Hacktoberfest easily and usefully!</h2>
<p>
  Well, I just finished my 4 PRs this year, and got a few
  questions on how to complete the Hacktoberfest for people
  that are not used to open-source development.
</p>
<p>
  I have an easy trick to do so. NPM modules are in fact packages
  that should only contain the actual code, eventual mappings for
  built code and the <code>package.json</code> file.
</p>
<p>
  Sadly, it is often not the case. It frequently contains a lot
  of contents that ain't supposed to be in the distributed code.
  It leads to wasted disk space and network bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
  A simple yet useful way to contribute to the open-source
  community is to reduce the NPM modules size. To identify which
  modules needs your help, go to any of your NodeJS project and
  run the following command:<br />
  <code>du -ch -d0 node_modules/*</code><br />
  To focus on the biggest modules, you can filter the output:<br />
  <code>du -ch -d0 node_modules/* | grep M</code>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Now we know which modules are too heavy. On the DiagRAMS Technologies
  API, the heaviest is <code>typescript</code> with 61Mb.<br />
  To browse the repository code, just run:<br />
  <code>npm repo typescript</code>
</p>
<p>
  Now we can investigate, I think you should avoid big modules like
  TypeScript for your first PRs since it can be complicated to understand.
  Most heavy modules are not using the
  <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#files"><code>files</code></a>
  field in their <code>package.json</code> file.
</p>
<p>
  Once you could identify which files are required and which ain't, you
  can clone and fork the repository:
</p>
<pre>
  # Clone and install
  git clone git@github.com:{my_usersame}/{my_fork}.git;
  cd module;
  npm i;

  # Package the module and see its size
  npm pack;
  du -h my_fork-x.x.x.tgz

  # Add the `file` field to the package.json


  # Package the module again and check its new size
  npm pack;
  du -h my_fork-x.x.x.tgz

  # Install the module in your projet and check
  # it still works
  cd my_project;
  npm install my_fork-x.x.x.tgz;
  npm test;
</pre>
<p>
  Your are now ready to submit your pull-request with the
  package size before and after your modifications!<br />
  Simple, ecological and useful, mission accomplished!
