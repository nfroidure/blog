<h2>Match IE8 With Rework And Gulp!</h2>
<p>
  Rework is a very powerful tool. It allows working with CSS contents in a
  friendly manner. Let&#039;s improve you IE8 compatibility with it.

  I discovered

  recently thanks to the
  <a
    title="Read his blog post"
    href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/custom-css-preprocessing/"
    >Nicolas Gallagher recent blog post</a
  >. It made me think about the recent ChtiJS build migration from Grunt to
  Gulp. One thing I did with our Grunt build was to

  by removing each rem units and replacing them with px units. It worked well
  but wasn&#039;t perfect since it didn&#039;t took in count the CSS syntax and
  could have lead to bugs for complex stylesheets.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, give up rem units just for IE8 support is a bad idea. The
  rem unit system is really

    >powerful</a

  when you want to size your contents. It gives you the em advantages without
  the well know nested em problems.
</p>
<p>
  So I decided to create a Rework plugin in order to reproduce this behavior
  more safely. I called it
  <a
    title="See the public repository"
    href="https://github.com/nfroidure/rework-rem2px"
    >rework-rem2px</a
  >
  and you can already find it on NPM. It works well, but the IE specific
  stylesheet were still containing some extra code, especially media queries
  that old IE version doesn&#039;t understand.

  Thanks to the community, something already exists.

  remove media queries from a CSS file and also allows you to specify some
  expressions for wich you want to keep the media queries content in place that
  matches.

  Ended up with this

<pre> // CSS<br />gulp.task(&#039;build_styles&#039;, function(cb) &#123;<br /> var keepmatches = &#91;<br /> &#039;screen and (min-width: 61rem)&#039;,<br /> &#039;print&#039;<br /> &#93;;<br /><br /> gulp.src(conf.src.less + &#039;/main.less&#039;)<br /> .pipe(g.less())<br /> .pipe(g.autoprefixer())<br /> .pipe(gulp.dest(conf.build.css))<br /> .pipe(g.rework(queryless(keepmatches), rem2px(16)))<br /> .pipe(g.rename(&#123;<br /> suffix: &#039;-ie&#039;<br /> &#125;))<br /> .pipe(gulp.dest(conf.build.css))<br /> .once(&#039;end&#039;, cb);<br />&#125;); </pre>
