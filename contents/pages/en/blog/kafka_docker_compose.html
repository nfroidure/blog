  Innovation is often driven by data. Through my various professional
  experience, I naturally went to use message queuing and then streams
  processing.
</p>
<p>
  I first used Kinesis for its ease of use but it do not support topics
  and it is not open-source with is not good to stay cloud agnostic so
  I decided to switch to Kafka for my new position at DiagRAMS.
</p>
<p>
  The thing is that there is no official Kafka docker image which lead to
  a lack of documentation on how to use it. This article may help you
  to spend less time on it than I had to.
</p>
<h3>Configuring docker-compose</h3>
<p>
  If you like using <code>docker-compose</code> for your developer
  environment, here is the recipe.
</p>
<p>
  I choose to use the Bitnami images (feel free to share yours!) since
  no official one exists at the time of this writing.
</p>
<p>
  I also explicitly declare the network options for two main reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I need to choose the IP range range docker uses to avoid collisions
    with my various VPC (which led to a few annoying moments configuring
    my VPN connection...),
  </li>
  <li>
    Apache Kafka uses an advertising system to share the brokers hosts
    leading to an easier setup if you can rely on a fixed IP adresses
    for them to fill the <code>KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS</code>
    environment variable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the result:</p>

  You can add more brokers if you wish thought is it not generally
  useful for development. Just beware that you will have to tweak
  the various environment variables.
</p>
<h3>Connecting with Kafdrop</h3>
<p>
  Kafdrop can be directly added to the docker-compose file but I
  prefer not doing so to keep the development environment lighter.
</p>
<p>
  It also allows to selectively run Kafdrop for both local and
  production environments.
</p>
<p>
  So let's run Kafdrop once we need it with that simple command:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 \
  -e KAFKA_BROKERCONNECT="10.5.0.1:9092" \
  -e JVM_OPTS="-Xms32M -Xmx256M" --network myapp \
  -e SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXTPATH="/" \
  obsidiandynamics/kafdrop:latest
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Note that <code>--network myapp</code> allows Kafdrop to
  live in the same network than our Kafka brokers.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the command for production were you will probably need to
  add the SSL configuration like this:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 \
  -e KAFKA_BROKERCONNECT=$(node -e "process.stdout.write($(terraform output kafka_bootstrap_brokers))") \
  -e JVM_OPTS="-Xms128M -Xmx2G" -e KAFKA_PROPERTIES=$(echo security.protocol=SSL | base64) \
  -e SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXTPATH="/" \
  obsidiandynamics/kafdrop:latest
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  As you can see, I directly retrieve the Kafka brokers via my
  Terraform states, feel free to do so or simply add it by hands.
</p>
<h3>Using Kafka scripts</h3>
<p>
  By reading the Kafka docs, you will probably be prompted to use
  the scripts embedded by Kafka, here is, for example, how you
  would create a topic with the above setup:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
docker-compose exec kafka /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh \
  --create \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --replication-factor 1 \
  --partitions 1 \
  --topic users
</pre>
</p>
<p>Listing available commands is done simply that way:</p>
<p>
<pre>
docker-compose exec kafka ls /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Kafka is an interesting technology, that said, you should be aware
  that using Kafka is not on its own a passport for managing big data.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I found out that searching for documentation often leads
  to Confluent specific tutorial which is not great. I think that
  using free software should not be tied to a particular company
  so I hope more people will take some time to tell how to use raw
  Kafka, I will be glad to read it ;).
