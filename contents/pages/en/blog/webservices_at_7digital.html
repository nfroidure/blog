<h3>A bit of context</h3>

<p>
  As you may have noticed, the project team at 7 Digital has a very different
  way to ship software than the product team.<br />
  Indeed, what make us working so differently is mainly timelines. We have to
  ship features on a regular basis in order to get feedback from our partners.
</p>

<h4>Custom projects</h4>

<p>
  Our customer projects require us to slightly change our webservices behavior.
  From custom APIs to third party integrations. We need to be able to build
  several custom platforms at the same time without degrading our service's
  quality.
</p>

<h4>Transitioning</h4>

<p>
  All of it has to be done gradually, implying a lot of backward compatibility
  considerations on an old codebase with no tests at all.
</p>

<h4>Contractors</h4>

<p>
  We also have to manage relationship with contractors and keep sure we can
  provide them the environment quick enough to be sure they won't be stuck on
  their working days.
</p>

<h4>Project oriented</h4>

<p>
  We're building projects over a product. It sometimes enforce us to implement
  features that will then ship into our core features.
</p>

<h3>Modularization</h3>

<p>
  To address our projects specificities we had to create an highly modular
  codebase thanks to a few common patterns.
</p>

<h4>One repository per concern</h4>

<p>
  First of all, we created several normalized repositories: infrastructure,
  webservices, frontends. Each repository of the same category shares the same
  CLI/directory tree interface to avoid having to figure out what is where for
  each project.
</p>

<h4>A docker image per repository</h4>

<p>
  The subsequent fact of it is that each repository's goal is to contain the
  recipe to build a single Docker container.
</p>

<h4>Modularization issues</h4>

<p>
  But the modularization comes with its own costs and we had to automate their
  evolution to avoid falling into a messy codebase with disparate configurations
  for each project/microservice.
</p>

<h4>An automated update process</h4>

<p>
  Basically, what we're doing is maintaining a set of versioned macros that
  applies to a project once the module containing them is updated.
</p>

<h4>Automatically Customized Documentation</h4>

<p>
  Since building customer projects is like picking features in an existing
  toolbox plus creating specific ones, we automated the documentation in a way
  that allows us to spend 0 time on bundling it or on already documented
  features. We just focus on new features.
</p>

<h3>Code Architecture</h3>

<h4>Dependency Injection with Inversion of Control</h4>

<p>
  We're using an open-source tool I made that implement Dependency Injection
  with Inversion of Control and looks similar to what's done in Angular. There
  is a small difference though, since it also handle service shutdown. Indeed,
  to ensure high availability we must shutdown services like PostgreSQL only
  when every connections to the HTTP server where closed.
</p>

<h4>Pure functions for the win</h4>

<p>
  A side effect of using services to enclose global states is that we can use
  pure functions everywhere else. I won't cover functional programming here but
  you should really have a look at its patterns.
</p>

<h4>Documentation Driven APIs</h4>

<p>
  Like any developer, I prefer write code than documentation. But I also prefer
  using documented code. To conciliate those two paradoxical needs, I managed to
  tie documentation and code. By writing the documentation, you create (<a
    href="https://github.com/nfroidure/siso"
    >routing</a
  >, <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/strict-qs">input filtering</a>,
  <a
    href="https://github.com/nfroidure/asttpl/blob/master/src/realworld.mocha.js"
    >clients API</a
  >, ...).
</p>

<h4>Workflow oriented controller</h4>

<p>
  I am not an MVC fan. Indeed, experience proves that answering to an HTTP
  request is often more a unique workflow specific to a given endpoint. I would
  say I am using a Workflow Stages Service pattern where Workflow is a bunch of
  asynchronous sequential operation, Stages is about running pure functions or
  services functions and Service is just dealing with system's or third party
  global states.
</p>

<h4>Cache ready</h4>

<p>
  I think enforcing URLs uniqueness in the stricter manner possible is a very
  important thing. It makes caching strategy efficient. What's the point of
  taking trains to go to the office if your code is wasting resources? I want to
  code green and URI unicity is maybe the best improvement you can achieve for
  that matter.
</p>

<p>
  It can be less convenient for frontends that are forced to follow a strict
  pattern when using the API but since we are generating the client API they
  don't even know that those restrictions exists ;).
</p>

<p>
  Some old URIs contents are still varying but fortunately when frontends will
  all use the generated client API we will be able to change URIs transparently.
</p>

<h4>Still a work in progress</h4>

<p>
  Which leads us to the fact there is still some work in progress under the
  hoods. From JSONSchema definition to the RESTful shift, the road is long.
</p>

<h3>Deployment</h3>

<h4>One repository to rule them all</h4>

<p>
  Building and deploying several projects at the same time requires to be
  rigorous and rely on single sources of truth. To handle this, every single
  utility script, deployment configuration lies in a single centralized
  repository per project.
</p>

<p>
  Every repositories involved in a project are embedded into the infrastructure
  repository as a Git submodule in order to be able to setup the development
  environment by cloning a single repository.
</p>

<h4>Cloud Hosting Powers</h4>

<p>
  We managed to create scripts that aggregate each webservices/frontends
  definitions and output a platform agnostic project definition we can then
  convert for many targets: AWS, Google Cloud Engine or even a simple instance
  running Docker or PM2 if necessary.
</p>

<h4>Back to the future</h4>

<p>
  Since each project has its own hosting budget, traffic expectations, we want
  to provide more targets for deployments to precisely fit needs at the better
  cost.
</p>

<h4>Quality Insurance</h4>

<p>
  There is a lot of checks before shipping to UAT or production dramatically
  reducing risks to deploy non working versions. Most of the BDD tests I made
  also helped to ensure backward compatibility with the old APIs.
</p>
