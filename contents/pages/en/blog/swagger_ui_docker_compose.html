<h2>Your API documentation locally with SwaggerUI and docker-compose</h2>

<p>
  Back-end developers often gets their own SwaggerUI instance while
  developing their own APIs. Accessing the API documentation is
  not a problem for them.
</p>
<p>
  I often had to build APIs but there
  is still a moment when you don't want to put API docs online
  but you neither want to require your teammates to fork your
  project and run the whole project just for docs.
</p>
<p>
  I encountered that situation at DiagRAMS since data scientists
  needed to get access to the docs but it was a bit overkill for
  them to clone and setup the project locally.
</p>
<h3>OpenAPI goodness</h3>
<p>
  I made a back-end framework (called
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/whook">Whook</a>) that
  leverage a nice standard for documenting APIs:
  <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You cannot create a new route without documenting it. It
  not only ties documenting and coding. It ensures that
  documentation and code cannot drift overtime thanks to
  TypeScript and the
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/schema2dts">schema2dts</a>
  project.
</p>
<p>
  We plan to put our documentation online but we are currently
  moving fast on features and our API is not public at the moment.
  I also didn't want to create a new website for 3 visits a month,
  it wouldn't be green at all. So we needed a B plan.
</p>
<h3>Docker to the rescue</h3>
<p>
  As usual, Docker can be a great tool to give access to nice
  features locally. That way, you only run the server when you
  need it.
</p>
<p>
  My first approach was to use <code>docker run</code> with
  a local copy of the OpenAPI declaration:<br>
</p>
<code><pre>docker run -e "SWAGGER_JSON_URL=openapi.json" -v "$PWD/openapi.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/openapi.json" --rm -p 16640:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-ui</pre></code>
<p>
  But I then evolved to something more live since our API serves
  its own OpenAPI file, let's just use it.
</p>
<h3>Using docker-compose</h3>
<p>
  I couldn't simply fill up the <code>SWAGGER_JSON_URL</code> with our
  documentation URL. Indeed, for security reasons, the CORS are
  enabled on our API and it simply doesn't work.
</p>
<p>
  This is why I finally used 2 Docker images. One for SwaggerUI and
  another for proxying the API and change the
  <code> Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header.
</p>
<p>
  I made it generic and write this blog post since I think it can
  benefit to you or my future self. So here is the code:
</p>
<p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/nfroidure/79f6f33b6907af59fb496365cd7a5054.js"></script>
</p>
<noscript>
  <p>default.conf.template</p>
  <code><pre>
  server {
    listen ${NGINX_PORT} default_server;
    server_name ${NGINX_HOST};
    server_name_in_redirect off;

    location / {
      proxy_pass ${NGINX_API_URL};

      proxy_hide_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin;
      add_header    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'http://docs.localhost:16640' always;
    }
}
</pre></code>
  <p>docker-compose.yml</p>
  <code><pre>
version: "3.5"
networks:
  api_docs:
    name: 'api_docs'
    driver: bridge
    # Avoid colliding with the AWS VPC subnet
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: 10.6.0.0/16
          ip_range: 10.6.0.0/24
          gateway: 10.6.0.1
          aux_addresses:
            swagger: 10.6.0.2
            api: 10.6.0.3
services:
  swagger:
    image: swaggerapi/swagger-ui
    networks:
      - 'api_docs'
    ports:
      - "16640:8080"
    environment:
      - SWAGGER_JSON_URL=http://api.localhost:16641${API_PATH-/openapi.json}
  api:
    image: nginx
    networks:
      - 'api_docs'
    volumes:
      - ./default.conf.template:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template
    ports:
      - "16641:80"
    environment:
      - NGINX_HOST=_
      - NGINX_PORT=80
      - NGINX_API_URL
</pre></code>

<p>
  The same approach can be taken for allowing frontend devs to
  build the app without cloning the API.
