<h2>No more middlewares, please</h2>
<p>
  When it comes to programming, there is a trap on which every programmer fall:
  elegant code. I'm often surprised to see even experienced developers
  qualifying a code snippet as elegant or beautiful.
</p>
<p>
  From my point of view, each time I found an API interface allowing me to
  create some elegant code, it ended up as a nightmare codebase, full of
  unmaintainable spaghetti code.
</p>
<p>
  Most of those nice, elegant and cool APIs fallen in disgrace in developers
  minds:

    done.

    >: Not that object and classes are harmful but thinking everything in term
    of objects/classes is a non-sense. Can't remind the time I find out that a
    fully OOP application was easily maintainable.

      >ORM/ODM</a
    >: Even OOP guys find it harmful. I spent horrible moments using Mongoose.
    Would not recommend it to my worst enemy.

    >: Everything is in the name. Mixing is the best way to get messy code.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  My current statement is:
  <strong
    >if you find some code elegant, it has great chances to be the next bullshit
    you'll step in</strong
  >.

<h3>Here be middlewares</h3>
<p>
  As a JavaScript developer I heavily used Express with NodeJS. At first, I
  found its middleware system really elegant. Well, at first.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>When it comes to debugging, it is just a nightmare.</strong> Your
  <strong>stack traces are unreadable</strong>. When you open a controller, you
  have to check what happens before it is invoked and what will be done next to
  fully understand its behavior.
</p>
<p>
  You end up with <strong>lots of a god objects</strong>, <code>req</code>,
  <code>res</code> and <code>app</code> for instance, that may or may not
  contain: a query, some cookies, encoded or decoded body, that method or this
  other one... It not only makes you mad when it comes to work on an Express
  application but also <strong>makes the code reuse very difficult</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, to reuse a controller, you have to find out every middlewares it
  depends on and set them up in the Express application where you want to reuse
  it. Problem: There is great chances that the same middleware is already in use
  but with a different version. And it is not the same shitty property that is
  set on that shitty god object.
</p>
<p>
  This is why I think <strong>middlewares are an anti-pattern</strong>. Your
  controller should contain the complete workflow that allows you to get a
  response from an HTTP request. Transforming the following usual code:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nfroidure/3c0a5858518663be186a1a64d160ee31.js"></script>
<noscript
  ><pre>
  module.exports = (app) => {

    // where the hell is this config set?
    const config = app.get('config');
    // How can I see what this timer do?
    const timer = app.get('timer');

    app.post((req, res, next) => {
      const data = {};
      // Which middleware set up this query params?
      if(req.query.ms) {
        data.when = timer.now();
      } else {
        data.when = new Date(timer.now()).toISOString();
      }
      // How this body was set, in which middleware?
      if(config.repeatBody) {
        data.body = req.body;
      }
      res.jsonBody = data; // Which consequences setting that jsonBody has?
      next(); // What happens then? New headers? Body transformations?
    })

  };
</pre
  ></noscript
>
<p>Into something way more expressive:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nfroidure/43a0eeb06549aeb32dd23c91fa5e0f11.js"></script>
<noscript
  ><pre>
// No middleware, just pure functions
const getBodyFromReq from 'pureBodyParser';
const getQueryFromReq from 'pureQueryParser';
const sendToRes from 'pureResponseMaker';

// Use dependency injection for required services
// app/config/timer just come from this function caller
module.exports = ({ app, config, timer}) => {

  app.post((req, res) => {
    // Promise based workflow instead of a middleware chain
    // could have been async/await too
    Promise.all([
      // No surprise, the body comes from the pureBodyParser module
      // But I can already guess it allows JSON or YAML
      getBodyFromReq.bind(null, req, ['json', 'yaml']),
      // And so on for the query
      getQueryFromReq.bind(null, req),
    ])
    .then(_buildResponse.bind(null, {timer, config})
    // No surprise, the response is sent by the pureResponseMaker module
    // But I can already guess it could output JSON or YAML
    .sendToRes(sendToRes.bind(null, req, res, ['json', 'yaml'], 200));
  });

};

// the pure function that process the request
// could be reused in a completly different context
// a frontend service worker or a websocket server
function _buildResponse({timer, config}, [body, query]) => {
    const data = {};
    if(query.ms) {
      data.when = timer.now();
    } else {
      data.when = new Date(timer.now()).toISOString();
    }
    if(config.repeatBody) {
      data.body = req.body;
    }
    return data;
  }

  Since the controller is strongly tied to its dependencies, you could just copy
  paste it into your other projects and npm install the various modules it
  actually uses. Magic? No, simple, atomic, reliable code. Nothing elegant, no
  hype, just stupid code telling what it does.
</p>
<p>
  One could argue that it introduces huge boilerplates. We are switching from a
  24 lines controller to a 42 one. My advice is that
  <strong
    >the glue code that strongly tie the controller with its actual underlying
    logic can be considered as comments that ends up to be code</strong
  >.
</p>
<p>
  The middleware based code, to be inclusive, should add comments telling where
  all that magic happens. But the fact is that commenting is a shitty way to
  help others to grasp your code. I personally use it only to explain something
  I cannot show with meaningful code. Most of the time, it's all about business
  constraints or legacy issues.
</p>
<p>
  Also, nothing impeach you to group several stages of your workflow into a
  single pure function if you figure out that a particular step sequence is used
  in most controllers. Importing this function will always show the way for
  readers to find out their content.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, this workflow approach is in my opinion way more adapted to HTTP.
  Indeed,
  <strong
    >what is an HTTP endpoint except a function that takes a request and returns
    a response?</strong
  >
  Why would we have to deal with something else than functions decomposing it
  into simple steps?
</p>
<p>
  As a conclusion, I would say that
  <strong>good code is not smart or elegant</strong>. It is readable, reliable,
  naive in a word: simple. And you probably know how hard it is to do simple ;).
</p>

  Edit: I ended up bringing up all those preferences in a JavaScript module
  intended to help building REst APIs called
