<h2>Watching Your NodeJS Projects's Dependencies The Easy Way</h2>
<p>
  âš  Beware: This article is outdated. The watchdep approach is not relevant
  anymore since you can subscribe to versions only reducing noises of listening
  to the entire project's activity.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    TL; DR:<br />
    <code>sudo npm install -g watchdeps</code><br />
    <code>cd myproject && watchdeps -u username</code>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Since NPM made easy the dependency management, we tend to use a lot of third
  party code. That's a good thing. Keep not repeating yourself.

  That said, embedding third party code is not just about npm installing
  modules.
</p>
<p>
  As developpers, we're responsible of listening to new versions, changes,
  issues etc. of that code.
</p>
<p>Since I couldn't accept spending my lifetime doing the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

    />
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  I created a simple CLI utility called
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/watchdeps">watchdeps</a>. It just watch
  every dependencies of a Node project for you by simply running one command.
</p>
<pre>
  sudo npm i -g watchdeps
  cd myproject/
  watchdeps -u nfroidure
  # Done!
</pre>
<p>
  That's it! All your dependencies with a GitHub repository associated are now
  watched and you'll know everything about its evolution. Simple enough?
