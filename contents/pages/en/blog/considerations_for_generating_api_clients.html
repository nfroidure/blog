<h2>Considerations for Automatic Generation of API Clients</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    TL; DR:<br />
    Generating simple, unopinionated, API clients is the way to go.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays, with APIs built on top of HapiJS, ExpressJS or even your custom
  router like in my case, there is no more field for building undocumented APIs.
  The <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> initiative (formerly known
  as Swagger) is now providing a strong and heavily supported API documentation
  format.
</p>
<p>
  Currently frontend developers expect having a clear and straightforward way to
  consume your APIs. But providing a documentation is not enough in my opinion.
  We must take the opportunity of formal API descriptions to also generate
  client APIs.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, if you look at
  <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/">Swagger Codegen</a>, you'll find
  there are a lot of clients generators ready to use.
</p>
<p>
  I recently had to generate a client API for that good old AngularJS framework
  (which is far better than Angular2 in my opinion).
</p>
<p>
  Sadly, the AngularJS client API codegen is generating an API interface
  leveraging POO (an irrelevant pattern for this case in my opinion) and
  introducing unnecessary complexities like spawning several files for a single
  API.
</p>
<p>
  Also, it creates as many function arguments for each endpoint than the
  possible parameters enforcing us to remember their order and creating function
  calls with a huge signature. In the context of an ES6 based AngularJS
  application, I wanted to use ES6 destructuring for a nicer API interface.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to create one that would be aligned with the following architecture
  requirements for generating a good API client:
</p>
<h3>Automatically generated code should never be modified by hands</h3>
<p>
  Indeed, if we can generate some code once, we can do it again forever. So,
  generating the client API should be part of your frontend build process.
</p>
<p>
  In my case, I quickly created a Webpack loader matching the
  <code>*.swagger.json</code> allowing me to simply import the client API into
  the AngularJS application with a single line of code
  <code>require('./api.swagger.json');</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The good news with choosing to never change the generated code is that we do
  not care anymore about generating elegant or readable code. We just want to
  create an appropriate surface API.
</p>
<h3>API surface should hide HTTP details</h3>
<p>
  There is nothing worse than having thousands of line of frontend applications
  that depends on a particular HTTP implementation. Maintaining HTTP APIs
  retrocompatibility is a real pain (believe me, you do not want to write HTTP
  proxies for older versions support...).
</p>
<p>
  Until your API is public, you can avoid a lot of work by using a client API
  that masks HTTP calls by simply providing your functions with a single
  argument where you can put your parameters as object properties.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, in my API client,
  <code>GET /articles/{articleId}?token=x</code> simply becomes
  <code>getArticle({ articleId, token })</code>. What if the token need to be
  set in the <code>Authorization</code> header instead of in the query string?
</p>
<p>
  It will just be transparent for frontends, they will only have to generate the
  Swagger definition again, include it in their project and continue using the
  endpoint as if nothing changed.
</p>
<p>
  I kind of specialized on working on plain old ExpressJS projects and managing
  to make them RESTful progressively. Having that flexibility to smoothly change
  endpoints helps a lot. For example, transforming each POST into a PUT with
  client generated UUIDs become really easy.
</p>
<h3>API surface should be minimalist</h3>
<p>
  For the AngularJS client API I just export a service called
  <code>API</code> and having as much methods as there are operation ids on the
  swagger file. No POO, no token management, just map functions to HTTP calls.
</p>
<p>
  Using this client basically means creating another service on top of it that
  adds custom behaviors for the host application logic.
</p>
<h3>Nice side effects</h3>
<p>
  Since I started creating my REST APIs in a Documentation Driven way (I was
  till doing it
  <a
    href="https://github.com/Rest4/Rest4-php/blob/master/php/class.RestAuthDigestDriver.php#L7-L30"
    >with PHP</a
  >
  at that time), I enforce a particular order for query parameters.
</p>
<p>
  It allows to ensure URLs are always unique for the same content. That way
  various cache layers are optimized (even public proxies that cannot assume the
  query parameters do not matters). You can read my
  <a href="toward_stricter_query_string_parser.html">post on strict-qs</a> for
  more informations about this.
</p>
<p>
  That said, it can be annoying for frontends developer to work with such strict
  APIs. The benefits of generating the client APIs is that we can take care of
  it for them so that they never face REST APIs misuse issues anymore.
</p>
<h3>Why not having some fun?</h3>
<p>
  Well. Generating code is less boring than writing it but I wanted to test an
  old idea. Why not making JavaScript templates in a new way? I already
  leveraged the AST power with
  <a href="./lets_subset_javascript.html">jsub</a> but I wanted to make
  something I called AST templating.
</p>
<p>
  The idea was to create templates that would be pure syntactically valid
  JavaScript files. That way, linters, syntax analyzers and all the usual
  JavaScript tools would just work on it.
</p>
<p>
  This is how I created
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/asttpl">astpl</a> and you can see how
  our API client looks like in its
  <a
    href="https://github.com/nfroidure/asttpl/blob/master/src/realworld.mocha.js#L82-L131"
    >real world tests</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Et voil√†! I hope you will enjoy creating your own API clients. I plan to
  create another template for React applications since the raw JavaScript
  codegen does not looks good either.
